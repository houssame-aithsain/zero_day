Tasks
0. Create and Setup Your Git and GitHub Account (advanced)

You will need Git for this project, and you might have to install it on your computer if you haven't done so already.
Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine â€“ they will be part of your commits. Tips

On GitHub.com:

    Using the graphic interface on the website, create the repository (if it's not done yet).
        Description: This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer.
        Public repo: zero_day
        No README, .gitignore, or license.

On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:

    Navigate to your home directory. Tips
    Create a directory zero_day. Tips
    Navigate to this new directory. Tips
    Initialize git and add the remote origin.
    Create a file README.md with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. This file is mandatory in projects.
    Add this new file to git, commit the change with the message "My first commit," and push to the remote server/origin. (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)

Good job!.
