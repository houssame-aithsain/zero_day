shell

mkdir 0x00-vagrant

    Move into the 0x00-vagrant directory:

shell

cd 0x00-vagrant

    Create a new file called README.md:

shell

touch README.md

    Open the README.md file in a text editor (such as Emacs or any command line editor):

shell

emacs README.md

    Write the output of the uname command without any options in the file. For example:

markdown

The command `uname` without any options prints: Linux

    Save the file and exit the text editor.
    Add the README.md file to the Git repository:

shell

git add README.md

    Commit the changes with an appropriate message:

shell

git commit -m "Add answer to the uname command"

    Push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub:

shell

git push origin main
